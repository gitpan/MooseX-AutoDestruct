NAME
    MooseX::AutoDestruct - Clear your attributes after a certain time

VERSION
    version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
        package Foo;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
        use MooseX::AutoDestruct;

        has foo => (
            traits => ['AutoDestruct'],
            is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', lazy_build => 1,
            ttl => 600, # time, in seconds
        );

        sub _build_foo { --some expensive operation-- }

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::AutoDestruct is an attribute metaclass trait that causes your
    attribute value to be cleared after a certain time from when the value
    has been set.

    This trait will work regardless of how the value is populated or if a
    clearer method has been installed; or if the value is accessed via the
    installed accessors or by accessing the attribute metaclass itself.

TRAITS APPLIED
    No traits are automatically applied to any metaclasses; however, on
    use'ing this package an 'AutoDestruct' attribute trait becomes
    available.

USAGE
    Apply the AutoDestruct trait to your attribute metaclass (e.g. "traits
    => ['AutoDestruct']") and supply a ttl value.

    Typical usage of this could be for an attribute to store a value that is
    expensive to calculate, and can be counted on to be valid for a certain
    amount of time (e.g. caching). Builders are your friends :)
