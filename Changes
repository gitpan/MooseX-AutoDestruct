Changes for MooseX::AutoDestruct

0.007     2011-03-12 20:47:06 America/Los_Angeles
    * Switch over to Dist::Zilla
    * Ensure V1Traits has the main module loaded so the inline packages
      are present

0.006 - Mon  7 Mar 2011
    * Make sure all our packages have a $VERSION -- not having this was
      causing problems with the CPAN indexer.

0.005 - Mon  7 Mar 2011
    * We now suppport Moose v2 (whenever it comes out :))  The traits were
      refactored into versioned traits, and the register_implementation()
      function was made smarter to deal with this as well.

0.004 - Sun Aug 15 2010
	* AutoDestruct now uses the generated clearer method, if we have one,
	  rather than clearing inline.  (This should allow clearer wrappers to
	  work as expected.)

0.003 - Mon Jul 19 2010
	* Fix inline clearing code; add tests
	* Skip meta tests at the moment (not written/ready)

0.002 - Fri Jul 16 2010
	* add very basic (and redundant) builder tests
	* make the test suite a touch quieter
	* first non-developer release!

0.001_03 - Thu Jul  8 2010
	* Remove an errant requires
	* Doc improvements

0.001_02 - Tue Jul  6 2010
	* Additional tests exercising the attribute from the meta side of things
	* Correct how enforce_doomsday() was calling doomsday() (namely, now it
	  passes the instance to doomsday() like it should

0.001_01 - Sun Jul  4 2010
	* Initial release -- marked as developer, as we need more tests!
